### NB

Downside to the alternative Membership badge mentioned above:
 * It doesn't work for leaders in the "Leaders" Six/Patrol as they are not shown in Badges By Person, so one has to remove leaders from this six/patrol.
 * Staged badge means that OSM stock assumes that each stage is a different badge. (See [#1])
